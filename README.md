# Bigmart Salse Prediction
The primary aim of this project is to build a sales prediction model for the Bigmart dataset.
Modeling is done using machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
The Cross-Validation technique is also used for tuning hyperparameters.

# Libraries used
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

# Dataset
